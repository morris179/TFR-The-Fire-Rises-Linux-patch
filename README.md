# TFR-The-Fire-Rises-Linux-patch
Simple bash script for fixing most broken images and icons for the Hearts of Iron IV mod 'The Fire Rises' on Linux.

The Fire Rises has many textures which are not named correctly (case sensitivity). While Windows is case insenitive, the same does not apply on Linux.
This will fix most textures, but not all of them, since there are many which can't be reduced to a general case.
A better option than this script would be something that emulates window's file name case insensitivity, but for all who don't want to use an emulator, this script works fine.

Run the .sh by using `sh script.sh` in your terminal.
